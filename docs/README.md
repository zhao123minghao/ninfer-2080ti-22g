# NInfer documentation

Start with the [project README](../README.md) for the CUDA 12.8 V100X2 build, conversion of the
local LM Studio Q4_K_M model, and the 180,000-token INT8-KV/MTP3 launcher. It also retains the
published-artifact CLI and HTTP examples for other profiles.

## User guides

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [CLI](cli.md) | text, chat-history, image/video input, output streams, sampling, MTP, dual-GPU (`--tp 2`) execution, and common runtime options |
| [HTTP serving](serving.md) | OpenAI Responses/Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, state, streaming, token counting, authentication, tool calls, dual-GPU serving, and YaRN extended context |
| [Performance](performance.md) | V100X2 85K-occupancy acceptance method and measurement status; inherited RTX 5090 single-request, concurrent-decode, MTP/DFlash and 1M-context results |
| [CLI examples](../examples/cli/) | committed text, multimodal, thinking, long-decode, and long-context inputs |

The executable `--help` output is the exact source for command-line option spelling and defaults.

## Maintainer references

The active references under [`maintainer/`](maintainer/) record current architecture, model,
artifact, and maintenance contracts. These files are not additional user workflows or installed
API documentation.

Pending implementation work:

- [Softmax Attention organization and migration](maintainer/softmax-attention.md) describes the
  single target state for an unfinished source and public-contract cutover; it is not the current
  implementation map.
