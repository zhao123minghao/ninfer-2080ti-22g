// ninfer::ops - two-device collectives.
//
// These are the cross-device primitives every tensor-parallel (tp == 2) forward pass needs: one
// summing reduction for row-parallel projections, one row gather for the vocabulary-split output
// head. Both operate on an ExecutionContext holding exactly two DeviceContexts and use each
// device's own compute stream; no stream parameter is accepted, because "the stream a device
// executes on" is already a property of its DeviceContext and a second, disagreeing stream story
// would break the ordering guarantees documented below.
//
// TRANSPORT. Payloads move with cudaMemcpyAsync(cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice) over unified virtual
// addresses, which every 64-bit Linux CUDA context has: a device pointer already names its
// device, so this one entry point expresses a cross-device transfer as well as a local one. When
// the driver grants peer access and startup validates it, the copy is a direct device-to-device
// PCIe transfer. Linux translated IOMMU domains (DMA/DMA-FQ) prohibit direct P2P regardless of
// advertised support or small-copy results. If either device uses such a domain, peer access is
// unavailable, or copies fail the exact startup check, both directions are disabled and CUDA
// stages the same copy through an explicit pair of long-lived pinned host buffers. This avoids the
// opaque driver-side staging path observed with UVA D2D copies behind translated IOMMU domains.
// Startup validates that route too before allowing inference. Both qualified paths are
// stream-ordered, so callers need no peer-access branch; enable_peer_access() below reports which
// one is active.
//
// The equivalent cudaMemcpyPeerAsync entry point is deliberately NOT used: it is rejected inside a
// stream capture region (cudaErrorStreamCaptureUnsupported), which would make the whole
// tensor-parallel decode program uncapturable. See src/ops/common/allreduce.cu's pull_peer().
//
// ORDERING. Every transfer is a PULL: rank r reads the peer's source into storage that rank r
// alone owns, on rank r's own stream. Nothing a rank owns is ever written by the peer's stream, so
// the classic push hazard -- the peer overwriting a staging buffer that this rank has not finished
// reading yet -- cannot exist. Each rank issues two event records and two event waits:
//
//   stream(r):  ...producer of the rank-r inputs...
//               record(inputs_ready[r])
//               wait(inputs_ready[1-r])              // peer's source is complete
//               [direct] peer source -> rank-r storage
//               [staged] rank-r source -> host[r], record(transfer_ready[r]);
//                        wait(transfer_ready[1-r]); host[1-r] -> rank-r storage
//               record(pull_done[r])
//               wait(pull_done[1-r])                 // peer has finished reading MY source
//               ...local combine, for allreduce_sum...
//
// The two waits carry the whole correctness argument:
//
//   * wait(inputs_ready[1-r]) makes the inbound copy read a completed peer source, both within a
//     call and across calls -- in call k+1 that event is recorded after call k's local work on the
//     peer's stream, so the next pull cannot start before the previous call finished with the
//     source it reads.
//   * wait(pull_done[1-r]) is the write-after-read barrier for THIS rank's own source: it
//     guarantees the peer has finished reading rank r's buffer before rank r (or the caller, on
//     return) overwrites it. For allreduce_sum that protects the in-place combine; for both ops it
//     is what makes back-to-back calls that reuse the same buffers safe.
//
// POST-CONDITION. On return each rank's stream is ordered after the peer's read of that rank's
// inputs. Therefore an unbounded sequence of calls sharing the same buffers, staging, and
// PeerEvents needs NO host synchronization between calls -- which is exactly what a captured
// CUDA graph replays, and what a decode token's collectives do. For the 27B model that is
// 128 all-reduces (64 layers x 2 row-parallel projections: the mixer output and the MLP down
// projection) plus one allgather_rows per logit column, so 129 collectives at batch 1.
//
// Everything in a call is stream-ordered CUDA work (memcpy, event record, event wait, kernel
// launch): there is no host round trip or host-memory spin flag in the hot path. The explicit
// fallback does use pinned host memory as a DMA landing zone, but never synchronizes the host
// between legs. That is what makes the sequence capturable. Measured: with both device streams enrolled in ONE
// capture -- the peer's stream joined to the origin's by an event fork -- the record/wait pairs
// above become graph EDGES rather than nodes, and the whole 128-collective decode program
// instantiates as a single cross-device cudaGraphExec. Event objects and staging storage are
// caller-owned and created once, because cudaEventCreate and cudaMalloc are not capturable.
//
// CALLER OBLIGATION -- the legacy default stream. These ops read their inputs on
// DeviceContext::stream, which core creates with cudaStreamNonBlocking and which therefore does
// NOT implicitly synchronize with a device's legacy default stream. Work issued with the plain
// cudaMemcpy/cudaMemset/<<<...>>> forms (no stream argument) lands on that default stream and is
// unordered against these collectives. A caller that stages inputs that way must retire them
// first (a device or stream synchronize, or an event); producing the inputs on
// DeviceContext::stream needs no extra step. This trap is invisible in single-device code, where
// the default stream orders everything.
//
// After a call returns the work is enqueued but not complete; the caller synchronizes each
// device's own stream, or lets subsequent stream-ordered work depend on it, as usual.

// Qualifies the actual cross-device copy route at startup. On Linux, first resolve both CUDA
// devices' PCI bus IDs to /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/iommu_group/type. DMA and DMA-FQ select the
// pinned host-staged route without ever enabling direct P2P, even if a small probe could pass. Otherwise,
// when both directions advertise peer access, enable them and check two distinct 16 KiB patterns
// with the collectives' UVA D2D API on
// their destination compute streams. Returns true only when both copies are exact. A data
// mismatch or unavailable peer access disables both directions (including previously enabled
// access), verifies the same copies through CUDA's host-staged route, emits one diagnostic, and
// returns false. A failed staged check or CUDA API error throws; inference must not continue.

// temporary probe buffers, synchronizes each compute stream, and releases its buffers while

//
// Re-recording an event a previous call already recorded is well defined: cudaStreamWaitEvent

// sequential calls. Instances are not thread-safe: one instance belongs to one stream pair. A
